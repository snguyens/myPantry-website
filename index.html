		<p id="infotext"><i>Welcome to myPantry, where you can manage your pantry, shopping lists, and recipes!</i> You are capable of searching for new recipes based off the items contained in their pantry. If you feel the need to restock your pantry, this application will help you find nearby supermarkets that are open! This application utilizes many APIs/frameworks/libraries, including: SQLite, Recipe Puppy API, SearchUPC API, AV Foundation, Google Maps API, and Google Places API. By uniting functionalities such as list making, market finder, and recipe search, we can accomplish the goal of pantry management.</p>

		<p id="infotext"><i>Welcome to your pantry!</i> Here, you can keep track of the current items in your pantry, including expiration dates and amounts remaining. The SQLite database engine has been implemented to create the database in which the pantry items are stored and pulled. The pantry items are listed in ascending order of amount remaining.</p>

		<p id="infotext"><i>Welcome to your recipes!</i> Here, you can generate random recipes based off the ingredients available in your pantry tab. By clicking "Find me a recipe!", you are provided with a random recipe, along with the ingredients required and the website containing the recipe. The API used to pull this information is described below.</p>	
		<br><br><br>
		<img id="corners" src = "images/recipepuppy.png" width = "400" height = "200">	
		<p id="infotext">The recipes are pulled from the Recipe Puppy API. The API works by inserting comma delimited ingredients into the parameter (i.e. rice,steak,pepper) of the URL. The API then returns a list of random recipes, including the name of the recipes, the ingredients required, and the website associated with the recipe. To use this recipe searcher, you must have at least one item in your pantry. Then, items are randomly pulled from your pantry and inserted into the parameter of the API. The API will then provide a list of recipes based on these ingredients, in which one is randomly selected and provided to you.</p>
